# CS50 Pomodoro
#### Video Demo:  https://youtu.be/AThWc91z3kE
#### Description:
This is a friendly Pomodoro for Programmers web app created for CS50 Final Project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This is a Pomodoro Web Application created especially for programmers.
The project was created in order to succeed CS50 Final Project specifications, using HTML, CSS and Javascript technologies.
In the app we can see some jokes about programming and memes when passing from a flow to another.
We have 3 types of timers in the Timers Dictionary:
•	Work: Having a timer of 25 minutes;
•	Short break: Having a timer of 5 minutes;
•	Long break: Having a timer of 15 minutes;
The idea as the image bellow suggest is to have 4 cycles of Work  Short break to then have a Long break to maximize your productivity in a sustainable format.
For this, I have passed this logic in the web application so the user would follow the correct work flow as the Pomodoro concept suggests.
For the design, it was selected a minimalistic style, having only the timer, the flow selector and the joke in the screen. For the functionalities as well, we can Start/Stop the timer in the same place as well as in the Reload Icon.
The colors used in this project was specially selected to bring "Darkula Theme" from VSCode vibe making the user experience more friendly.
Talking about the API, I used JokeAPI v2 to get Jokes from Programming World for its design and for being free to use not having to have a secret to use the API.
For this, I fetched the API in a separated file to make the code more clean and concise.

Coming back to the user experience, it was decided to not let the user to select the flow by himself in order to follow the following concept:

 The main screen should look like this:

And when we complete the work flow we can see this modal:

If you want to see what the other modals looks you can fork this repository and use Live Server to see it in your computer and also suggest changes to this project :)
