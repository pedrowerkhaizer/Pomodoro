#### Description:
Friendly Pomodoro web app created for CS50 Final Project using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. This is a Pomodoro for programmers and we can see some jokes about programming and memes when passing from a flow to another. The API selected was JokeAPI v2. 
For the design, it was selected a minimalistic style, having only the timer, the flow selector and the joke in the screen.
Also, it was decided to not let the user to select the flow by himself in order to follow the following concept:
